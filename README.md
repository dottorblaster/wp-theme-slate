# WordPress Slate Theme #

## Intro
I wanted to open source my blog theme so here we are. I think that's pretty nice, and looks awesome on a variety of screens.

This theme is **not** responsive, and never will be; maybe my next works will be responsive but right now I think a couple of plugins (like WPTouch) are the best way to reach a smartphone-oriented UX in less time.

## Depencencies
*	WordPress, my favourite blogging engine;
*	Thematic Theme Framework;
*	A browser that is not IE6.

I've not tested this whole thing with a bunch of combinations, some people said that's neat and if you want to implement some feature, well feel free to fork this.

## License of Slate
GPL3, that's enough.
